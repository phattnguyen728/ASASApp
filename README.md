Automotive Sales and Services Web App is made up of 3 microservices which interact with one another.

- **Inventory**
- **Services**
- **Sales**

## SERVICE MICROSERVICE (PORT 8080:8000)

For the Service microservice we have 3 models: Technician, AutomotbileVO, and Appointment. The Appointment model interacts with the technician and the automobile models. In order to generate an appointment, there has to be an existing technician. When generating a service appointment, it requires a VIN, Customer's information, Date and Time, a technician, and the reason for service. Once generated the VIN will be filters through the microservice poller verifying the VIN from the Inventory through the AutomobileVO value object to verify if the vehicle qualifies for VIP service. Through this microservice we are able to create, update, and keep track of appointments as well as keep track and manage the service history.

##      Service Value Object
 -      AutomobileVO

## SALES MICROSERVICE  (PORT 8090:8000)

 On the backend, the sales microservice has 4 models: Salesperson, Customer, Sale and AutomobileVO. Sale is the model that interacts with the all other three models. A new sale must use an existing salesperson, customer and unsold automobile in order to be successfully created.

 Salesperson model has three character fields: first_name (max length is 200), last_name (max length is 200) and employee_id (max length is 201).

 Customer model has three character fields for first_name (max length is 200), last_name (max length is 200) and phone_number (max length is 12).  And one text field for address.

Sale model has a decimal field for price with 2 decimal places and the automobileVO, salesperson and customer as foreign keys.

## Sales Microservice Value object

The AutomobileVO is a value object that gets data about the automobiles from the inventory using a poller. The sales poller automotically polls the inventory microservice for data, so the sales microservice is constantly getting the updated data and it checks to see if an automobile has been created so it can create or update the automobile accordingly.

It tracks only the VIN which is unique and a max length of 17 characters. And the Boolean field of whether or not the car has been sold.

The reason for integration between these two microservices is that when recording a new sale, you'll need to choose which car is being sold and whether or not it has been sold. Information on new automobiles lives inside of the inventory microservice.
